# The Simple_shell Project
Welcome to the end of low level programming i.e c programming language. All Thank to ALX in collaboration with Holberton School of Software engineering.

----------------------------------------

Simple Shell project 0x16.c - Sodash - This is a simple UNIX command interpreter based on bash and Sh.

# Overview
sodashy is a sh-compatible comand language interpreter that executes command read from the standard input or from a file.

# Requirement
All editors are allowed such as vi, vim emacs. But all the files must be complied on ubuntu 20.04 LTS (long time suport) either on virtualbox or the windows supported application, using the option -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
NOTE: All your files should end witha new line and a README file should be add to your project
In the project we are allowed to create and use our own main.h file for compilation. We are also given a prototype, the Prototype is going to br added in our main.h file

## Remember
Remember to commit (save changes) and push your header file to your github account

### NOTE
If you find our task helpful. you can follow Us on Github

# NOTE 1
Invocation Usage: Sodash Sodash is started with the standard input connected to the terminal. To start, compile all .c located in this repository by using this command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o sodash ./sodash Sodash is allowed to be invoked interactively and non-interactively. If sodash is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

# Thank you very much
